Thank you sir!\nThis is from Bubba Watson... pro golfer and a stand up guy.\nExactly the way I feel today.\n*****\nI\u2019m so confused right now. I see signs all over saying black lives matter. I\u2019m just trying to figure out which black lives matter. It can\u2019t be the unborn black babies. They are destroyed without a second thought. It\u2019s not black cops. They don\u2019t seem to matter. It\u2019s not my black conservative friends. They are told to shut up if they know what\u2019s best for them by their black counterparts. It\u2019s not black business owners. Their property does not mean anything. It\u2019s not blacks who fought in the military. Their statues are destroyed by the black lives matter protesters with disdain. So which black lives matter again?\nBlack Lives Matter. Of course they do! Then when multiple black police officers and individuals were killed during the \u201cpeaceful protests\u201d. I don\u2019t see any outrage? Black individually owned businesses burned to the ground. Silence. Deadliest weekend in Chicago. NOTHING!!\nI can\u2019t keep up. I just can\u2019t. I\u2019m exhausted trying to figure out what we\u2019re all supposed to do, believe, and be offended and outraged by next.\nTwo months ago, First Responders were all the rage. In fact, they were heroes. We gave them free coffee, meals, and cheers as they drove by. Today, we hate them and want them defunded because they can\u2019t be trusted.\nTwo months ago, truck drivers were the heroes, as well, for keeping America moving and the grocery stores stocked. Today we block the roads with protesters, drag them out of the cabs and beat them half to death.\nNurses and Doctors are still cool for now. But they may be unemployed. They too are heroes, unless of course they truly believe all lives matter. Then they\u2019re filled with hate and are part of problem like so many others.\nJust 45 days ago protests weren\u2019t \u201cessential\u201d and were considered criminal, selfish and a murderous activity. Today they are gloriously critical and celebrated. All of the obvious criminal and murderous activities are simply ignored. If you protest about lock downs for freedom, you are selfish and you will spread a virus. If you protest, loot, and riot for social justice, you are a warrior and the virus fades to the background.\nTrust the experts. No, not those experts. Don\u2019t wear masks ... wear masks, but only good ones. Wait, don\u2019t wear masks, wear anything as a mask. Never mind on the masks. Not sure, but if you don\u2019t, you hate people because you could be an asymptomatic spreader. Wait. That's not a thing anymore?\nFor 3 months, NOTHING was more important than social distance. In fact, we gave up all of our liberties for it. We canceled schools, medical and dental procedures, yet allowed the murder of babies, canceled activities, closed businesses, eliminated every spring rite of passage from prom to graduation, denied people funerals, even at Arlington, and we wrecked the economy for it. Then came social justice, and social distance was no more. Now things are more cut and dried though. A thousand people at three memorials for someone they never even met. It's a matter of \"respect\". But you can only assemble 100 or less people.\nI\u2019m really confused now. Look at the data, NO, not that data. Do the math. No, you can\u2019t do the math like that. Only the experts can understand the data and math. What do you mean other cities/states/governors are interpreting the data differently? Pools are safe in Indiana, but not Michigan? Playgrounds are safe in your town but not mine? Amusement parks are safe in Florida but not Ohio, nor Michigan.\nIf you are silent you are part of the problem. If you speak, you are part of the problem. If you have to ask, you don\u2019t understand. If you don\u2019t ask, you don\u2019t care.\nIt\u2019s all so predictable, tedious, and exhausting. Nothing adds up. It\u2019s one gigantic Math life problem, with ever changing denominators that I\u2019m sure the media and politicians are eagerly ready to solve for us...until the next \"crisis\".\nSo, for now I pray. I pray God will heal our land and bless the United States of America! Bless us with Wisdom, Kindness, Gentleness, Mercy, Love, Peace and Healing. Things that Really Matter! We all Matter in God's Eyes!",

Lewis(1942)\n\n\u201cAnd how did you manage to bring so many souls to hell at that time? -Because of fear. -Ah, yes. Excellent strategy; old and always current. But what were they afraid of? Fear of being tortured? Fear of war? Fear of hunger? -No. -Fear of getting sick. -But then, no one else got sick at that time? -No. -Yes, they were sick. -I'm sorry. -Nobody else was dying? -Yes, they died. -But there was no cure for the disease? -There was. -Then I don't understand. - Since no one else believed and taught about eternal life and eternal death, they thought they had only that life, and they clung to it with all their strength, even if it cost them their affection (they did not hug or greet each other, they had no human contact for days and days); their money (they lost their jobs, spent all their savings, and still thought themselves lucky to be prevented from earning their bread); their intelligence (one day the press said one thing and the next day it contradicted itself, and still they believed it all); their freedom (they did not leave their house, did not walk, did not visit their relatives. ...it was a big concentration camp for voluntary prisoners! They accepted everything, everything, as long as they could overcome their miserable lives one more day. They no longer had the slightest idea that He, and only He, is the one who gives life and ends it. It was like that, as easy as it had ever been.\u201d\nFrom the book \"Letters of the Devil to His Nephew\" by C.S. Lewis, the Christian author of \u201cThe Chronicles of Narnia\u201d...The book published in 1942.",

        "content": "       Since yesterday in the Austrian Parliament a politician presented one of our rapid antigen tests for COVID-19 and referred to it as \u2032\u2032 worthless \u2032\u2032 after using with Coke and a \u2032\u2032 positive \u2032\u2032 result, we are forced to take a stand on this topic. There are things to consider here that have been misused: For one thing, the \u2032\u2032 sample \u2032\u2032 was not swivelled out in a buffer. In a properly executed test, the sample is always swirled first in a liquid (buffer) that keeps the pH constant. Applying the \u2032\u2032 sample \u2032\u2032 (in this case coke that has a pH of 2,5) as in the case of the politician without using the buffer, you destroy the antibody protein of the test that comes with the Virus is reacting. This destroys the buffer layer and makes the positive marker visible. This result would also be expected if any other manufacturer had such an application. If the test had been properly applied, as described in the accompanying text, the test would be negative. In order to provide proof here, we have correctly executed the test with a coke. The result was negative as you can see in the video. Such tests should always be carried out by hospital staff or by being carried out by trained individuals to avoid such results and representations.",

A doctor friend suggested she be tested for legionnaires disease because she wore the same mask every day all day long. Turns out it WAS legionnaires disease from the moisture and bacteria in her mask. She was given antibiotics and within two days was better. WHAT IF these \"spikes\" in COVID are really something else due to mask wearing??\nCopied and pasted - and checked - it's true!",

While I know the HEADLINES over the last couple days have stated something entirely different, that is because journalism is dead. Again, THERE IS NO LAW THAT STATES YOU MUST WEAR A MASK. Ask our local Police chief or officers. They will not, and cannot, cite ANYBODY for not wearing a mask because the law does not exist. When you come across Newsom's \"orders\" online, you will see it's linked to a page that does not lead you to his Executive Order, BUT to the California Department of Public Health GUIDELINES! Again, NOBODY can be forced to wear a mask outside, in a business, or as an employee or customer. Spread the Word..... CA State Department of Public Health \"Guidance\" (Not public health orders): https://bit.ly/2YOfwDt CA Department of Public Health: https://bit.ly/2zHVTEC If you get headaches while wearing a mask check this video out Back when I first started Brazilian jiu jitsu, I would do things that all white belts do like get caught in\u2026 More Morning dose of common sense: what the science says about the masks... sorry for geeking out but we need this info out to the public.

        "content": "Rilievi anatomopatologici sui deceduti per Covid 19. Vi riporto Il mess.mandato nella' nostra chat di medici da colleghi di Brescia.....il nostro servizio di Anatomia Patologica ha iniziato ad eseguire autopsie sui pazienti COVID19-positivi, dopo qualche remora iniziale poich\u00e9 la loro societ\u00e0 scientifica internazionale ha classificato COVID-19 tra i patogeni appartenenti all\u2019hazard group 3 (al pari di antrace, prioni, alcuni micobatteri\u2026 per intenderci, Ebola appartiene all\u2019HG 4, che \u00e8 il livello massimo di pericolosit\u00e0). Ad oggi hanno totalizzato circa 50 autopsie, nella quasi totalit\u00e0 dei casi mirate ai polmoni. Stanno aspettando uno scafandro speciale per poter eseguire, in sicurezza, anche l\u2019esame autoptico sul cervello.\nLa nostra \u00e8 la pi\u00f9 ampia casistica mondiale, poich\u00e9 i cinesi hanno pubblicato solo i risultati di 3 autopsie \u201cminimally invasive\u201d (+ un altro isolato case report) e poich\u00e9 l\u2019unico altro ospedale italiano che esegue autopsie \u00e8 il Sacco (con riferiti circa 20 casi).\nVi riporto quello che ho carpito della dissertazione anatomo-patologica (presentata da Gianatti e Sonzogni) e gli interventi pi\u00f9 significativi di alcuni dei presenti.\nGi\u00e0 macroscopicamente i polmoni appaiono \u201cspotty\u201d, con aree iperemico/emorragiche alternate ad aree rosee. Istologicamente, alcune aree sono gravemente enfisematose, con vasi sanguigni enormemente dilatati (fino a 20 volte la norma) spesso repleti di microtrombi. In molti casi \u00e8 evidente un danno alveolare diffuso (DAD), con desquamazione dei pneumociti, formazione di membrane ialine e di un essudato fibrotico (come nell\u2019ARDS). Appare come una sindrome ad alta portata, con epatomegalia e vasi portali dilatati con trombosi diffuse a tutti i livelli. Anche il cuore appare ingrandito, presenta sempre un idropericardio ed una marcata ipertrofia ventricolare sx (ma sono quasi sempre pazienti ipertesi in anamnesi). In un caso hanno osservato un trombo quasi completamente ostruente la vena cava superiore e l\u2019atrio dx. Hanno notato spesso la risalita del diaframma, indice del fatto che ad un certo punto i polmoni non si espandono pi\u00f9, associata ad epatomegalia. Sessa, nell\u2019attesa di avere dati su campioni da SNC, ha chiesto di poter eseguire biopsie della mucosa olfattoria; COVID-19 d\u00e0 classicamente anosmia ed ageusia: potrebbe arrivare al tronco encefalico per via trans-sinaptica partendo dalle terminazioni nervose periferiche del nervo olfattorio o di quello linguale (oltrech\u00e8 dall\u2019innervazione dei polmoni). In questo scenario, parte dell\u2019insufficienza respiratoria potrebbe essere causata dal danno diretto del virus sui nuclei del tronco dell\u2019encefalo (nucleo ambiguo, del tratto solitario\u2026). Dal punto di vista delle cellule del sistema immunitario, nell\u2019interstizio intervengono molti macrofagi ma pochissimi linfociti. Rambaldi sottolinea che nel sangue dei pazienti con infezione da COVID-19 c\u2019\u00e8 un numero elevatissimo di cellule endoteliali (espressione del danno endoteliale causato direttamente dal virus) e che queste cellule scatenano uno storm citochinico che recluta soprattutto i macrofagi. \u00c8 anche per questo motivo che il cortisone ad alte dosi potrebbe funzionare. \u00c8 stato usato su 6 pazienti un farmaco anti-complemento (narsoplimab, lo studio \u00e8 chiuso) che ha ridotto drasticamente il numero di cellule endoteliali plasmatiche circolanti (ma non sono stati specificati i clinical end-points).\nIn conclusione: gli anatomo-patologi ci dicono di chiedere liberamente le autopsie che riteniamo opportune (soprattutto le morti improvvise, o i decessi nei pazienti relativamente giovani ed altrimenti sani), corredandole di quante pi\u00f9 informazioni possibili (comorbidit\u00e0, data di esordio dei sintomi, terapie effettuate, sistema di supporto di O2, passaggio in TI). Questo per capire quanto di \u201cpregresso\u201d ci sia nei polmoni disastrati che hanno esaminato e per spiegarsi alcuni reperti anomali (ad esempio un caso di amiloidosi oppure un abnorme ispessimento del miocardio che secondo Senni non pu\u00f2 essere riconducibile ad una miocardite acuta\u2026).io sono Eliana cammarata medico radiologo di la spezia ...la chat \u00e8 con i colleghi della specialit\u00e0 a Udine ..",

China is accused of inventing the Coronavirus in its Wuhan laboratory with whatever intent that might have prompted the venture.\n\nA Nobel laureate Japanese academician, Dr. Tasuku Honjo (pictured below), who had shared a 2018 Nobel prize for his outstanding works in the study of immunology, had revealed the reasons for blaming China for inventing the deadly virus that had already infected, maimed and killed millions across the globe.\n\nProfessor Honjo maintains, \u201cI know the Chinese labs where the virus was perfected. I called many times since the Wuhan breakout. Phones are dead. Doctors and technicians involved were killed.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cnatural viruses are temperature and climate-sensitive. Corona had affected every nation, irrespective of geography, climate and temperature. Had it been natural, it\u2019s spreading would have been limited to Wuhan like places and climate.\u201d\n\nDr. Honjo threw a challenge in support of his finding and the assertions, saying, \u201cif it\u2019s not proven even after my death, take away my Nobel prize.\u201d",

        "content": "Autopsies Prove that COVID-19 is a Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (Pulmonary Thrombosis) It is now clear that the whole world has been attacking the so-called Coronavirus Pandemic wrongly due to a serious pathophysiological diagnosis error. According to valuable information from Italian pathologists, ventilators and intensive care units were never needed. Autopsies performed by the Italian pathologists has shown that it is not pneumonia but it is Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (Thrombosis) which ought to be fought with antibiotics, antivirals, anti-inflammatories and anticoagulants. If this is true for all cases, that means the whole world is about to resolve this novel pandemic earlier than expected. However, protocols are currently being changed in Italy who have been adversely affected by this pandemic. The impressive case of a Mexican family in the United States who claimed they were cured with a home remedy was documented: three 500 mg aspirins dissolved in lemon juice boiled with honey, taken hot. The next day they woke up as if nothing had happened to them! Well, the scientific information that follows proves they are right! This information was released by a medical researcher from Italy: \u201cThanks to 50 autopsies performed on patients who died of COVID-19, Italian pathologists have discovered that IT IS NOT PNEUMONIA, strictly speaking, because the virus does not only kill pneumocytes of this type, but uses an inflammatory storm to create an endothelial vascular thrombosis.\u201d In disseminated intravascular coagulation, the lung is the most affected because it is the most inflamed, but there is also a heart attack, stroke and many other thromboembolic diseases. In fact, the protocols left antiviral therapies useless and focused on anti-inflammatory and anti-clotting therapies. These therapies should be done immediately, even at home, in which the treatment of patients responds very well. If the Chinese had denounced it, they would have invested in home therapy, not intensive care! So, the way to fight it is with antibiotics, anti-inflammatories and anticoagulants. An Italian pathologist reports that the hospital in Bergamo did a total of 50 autopsies and one in Milan, 20, that is, the Italian series is the highest in the world, the Chinese did only 3, which seems to fully confirm the information. In a nutshell, the disease is determined by a disseminated intravascular coagulation triggered by the virus; therefore, it is not pneumonia but pulmonary thrombosis, a major diagnostic error. Some world leaders doubled the number of resuscitation places in the ICU, with unnecessary exorbitant costs. According to the Italian pathologist, treatment in ICUs is useless if thromboembolism is not resolved first. \u201cIf we ventilate a lung where blood does not circulate, it is useless, in fact, nine (9) patients out of ten (10) will die because the problem is cardiovascular, not respiratory.\u201d \u201cIt is venous microthrombosis, not pneumonia, that determines mortality.\u201d According to the literature, inflammation induces thrombosis through a complex but well-known pathophysiological mechanism. Unfortunately, what the scientific literature said, especially Chinese, until mid-March was that anti-inflammatory drugs should not be used. Now, the therapy being used in Italy is with anti-inflammatories and antibiotics, as in influenza, and the number of hospitalized patients has been reduced. He also discovered that many deaths, even in their 40s, had a history of fever for 10 to 15 days, which were not treated properly. The inflammation does a great deal of tissue damage and creates ground for thrombus formation. However, the main problem is not the virus, but the immune hyperreaction that destroys the cell where the virus is installed. In fact, patients with rheumatoid arthritis have never needed to be admitted to the ICU because they are on corticosteroid therapy, which is a great anti-inflammatory. With this important discovery, it is possible to return to normal life and open closed deals due to the quarantine, though not immediately, but with time. Kindly share so that the health authorities of each country can make their respective analysis of this information, prevent further deaths and redirect investments appropriately; the vaccine may come later. *linkedin source",

        "content": "OK, since this video by Drs. Erickson and Massihi has been making the rounds on facebook, I feel like I need to respond. Now first of all, I actually agree with the basic premise that this is not as dangerous as we first thought and we should probably move to open. However they make many false and misleading claims so I feel like I need to respond. This video is I believe making the rounds because it sounds internally logical and has many facts that are either deliberately or inadvertantly misinterpreted and about 95% of the things they are saying are true and then there's the 5% that's the gotcha. So let's go through it point by point. 1. at around the 3 minute mark, he says that we should quarantine the people that are sick and not the people that are well. ABSOLUTELY CORRECT. However in order to quarantine the sick and not the well, you need to know who is sick and who is well. That's the problem with Covid-19 is that unlike measles or most other infectious diseases, people can spread the disease when they are asymptomatic so how do you know who needs to be quarantined and who doesn't? Ideally, you do what South Korea did and have lots of testing available and you test everyone and then you trace all their contacts and test them and now you know who has the virus and who doesn't and you quarantine those who have the virus and let the others go about their business. We did not have testing and we still do not have enough testing to test everyone. so what do you do when you don't know who has the virus? yeah, you quarantine everyone. 2. around the 4 minute mark, they say that they had 340 out of 5213 tests positive (6.5%). Then they talk about how 12% of the tests in california were positive and 39% of the tests in new york were positive. Then they say that Ca has 39 million people and 12% of them being positive means 4.5 million people have covid-19. THIS IS THE SINGLE GREATEST PROBLEM WITH THIS VIDEO. Either they are being purposely misleading or they completely forgot statistics 101. They are confusing testing within a high pretest probability cohort with a random sample of the population that can be extrapolated to the general population. Let me explain. Until now, the way covid testing worked was that there were so few tests that we only tested people that we were pretty sure had the disease. And even if we were pretty sure they had the disease, if they had mild symptoms, we didn't test them. Therefore the tested samples will have a much higher rate of positivity than the general population. This kind of thought process would be like I run an emergency room and tonight 10% of the people have a stroke. Then I extrapolate that to mean that 10% of the world is having a stroke tonight. That's obviously ludicrous. The sample of people coming to the ER is not representative of the entire population. There are currently random testing studies being done to look at prevalence in the general population and I've discussed them and they think the prevalence is about 2-3 percent. These are early studies and still should not be used to extrapolate nationwide and have problems dealing with bayesian probability and testing specificity but are FAR FAR better than using testing data in a hospital setting to the population. That's just plain wrong. He keeps saying he's following the science and using data. The problem is that he doesn't understand data and is misinterpreting it and is NOT following the science. 3. Around 13 minutes, they discuss Norway and Sweden. Sweden has 1,765 deaths. Norway has 182 deaths. He claims this is statistically insignificant. I have no idea what statistical test he used and I'm pretty sure he has no idea either because he didn't do one. The correct test to do would be a chi squared test with Yates correction. That gives a P value of <0.0001. That's about as statistically significant as it gets! In fact, you don't even need to do a statistical test on it. Sweden has 10 times the deaths as Norway. No one looks at a ten fold increase and says \"BAH, that's nothing!\" 4. Around 16 minutes he talks about the downsides of the shutdown. These are valid points there are DEFINITELY downsides. 5. Around 18 he starts talking about the immune system. He talks about how the immune system needs to be exposed to pathogens to develop. ABSOLUTELY TRUE. But then he takes immunological development in a child to adults in quarantine. NOT TRUE. Unless you live inside a bubble, your home and your yard have TRILLIONS of pathogens. No amount of lysol and handwashing is going to remove pathogens that you breathe in and touch all the time. Your own mouth has billions of microbes. Your skin is teeming with microbes. Fungal spores and viruses in the air. Your immune system will 100% not be weaker by being at home. Your immune system might get weaker if you stay home, don't exercise and eat candy all day but the fact of being home in an of it self will not harm your immune system. 6. Around 26 minutes he says academics and reality are two different things. This appeals to some people but in this case, they need to go back to academics to learn basic statistics. 7. Around 27 minutes he talks about all the fomites you bring from costco to your house and totally contradicts his own point from 18 minutes (#5) 8. Around 28 he talks about the logical inconsistency for being able to go to costco but not to work or church. Because you're going to be interacting with people at either place. YES, ABSOLUTELY TRUE. Ideally, people should go nowhere. But we do need to eat and there's no other mechanism available to get food so they are letting what they consider \"essential\" continue. Now what's considered essential is up for debate since they've said liquor stores are essential which I personally disagree with but there is a logic in that. 9. Around 30, he claims doctors are being pressured to add covid to the diagnosis. That is definitely not happening at Loma LInda University or any other institution that I've spoken to. 10. Around the same time he talks about how covid doesn't kill people, their preexisting condition kills them. well we know for a fact that young healthy people have died. not often and definitely having poor health before makes you more likely to succumb. 11. Around 33. they said widespread testing is needed to open the economy. YUP. THAT'S WHAT EVERYONE IS SAYING. 12. Around 34, he says that covid and flu kill people. Completely contradicting himself from 3 minutes ago. 13. Around 37 he talks about quarantining the sick. YES, but no one knows who is infected or not right now and THAT is the biggest problem. 14. Around 41 minutes, they said that no one does in house testing. Actually every major hospital does in house testing. Loma Linda, USC, UCLA, Stanford, U of Washington, etc. 15. Around 45 minutes he talks about staying home if you have symptoms. Yes, but maybe he's not aware that people are infectious and shedding virus when they have no symptoms and a significant proportion NEVER get symptoms but are still spreading the virus. That's what makes covid-19 harder to get a handle on. If people didn't shed virus until AFTER they had symptoms it would be very easy. Just tell everyone to stay home once they get symptoms. problem solved. Unfortunately, this one transmits before symptoms are evident. 16. Around 47 they claim the virus will mutate and become less and less virulent. There is absolutely zero basis for that claim. None WHATSOEVER. It's possible that it will mutate and become less virulent but then that virus will be out-competed by the parental strain that is more virulent. It's also possible that it will mutate and become MORE virulent. There is no basis for which to say that a virus will mutate and become less virulent. 17. Around 48 minutes, they make a claim saying that academics haven't seen a patient in 20 years. That's not how academic medicine works. I see patients every day. And I see the patients that are too complex for the doctors in the community to deal with. 18. Around 50 minutes, they claim that wearing masks and gloves reduces your bacterial flora. You get your bacterial flora from the food you eat, the clothes you wear, the air you breathe. Wearing masks and gloves have minimal impact on that especially since most people take those things off once they get home. They also claim that they spoke to Kern County public health commissioner who agrees with them. That's not true either.",

Therefore the tested samples will have a much higher rate of positivity than the general population. This kind of thought process would be like I run an emergency room and tonight 10% of the people have a stroke. Then I extrapolate that to mean that 10% of the world is having a stroke tonight. That's obviously ludicrous. The sample of people coming to the ER is not representative of the entire population. There are currently random testing studies being done to look at prevalence in the general population and I've discussed them and they think the prevalence is about 2-3 percent. These are early studies and still should not be used to extrapolate nationwide and have problems dealing with bayesian probability and testing specificity but are FAR FAR better than using testing data in a hospital setting to the population. That's just plain wrong. He keeps saying he's following the science and using data. The problem is that he doesn't understand data and is misinterpreting it and is NOT following the science. 3. Around 13 minutes, they discuss Norway and Sweden. Sweden has 1,765 deaths. Norway has 182 deaths. He claims this is statistically insignificant. I have no idea what statistical test he used and I'm pretty sure he has no idea either because he didn't do one. The correct test to do would be a chi squared test with Yates correction. That gives a P value of <0.0001. That's about as statistically significant as it gets! In fact, you don't even need to do a statistical test on it. Sweden has 10 times the deaths as Norway. No one looks at a ten fold increase and says \"BAH, that's nothing!\" 4. Around 16 minutes he talks about the downsides of the shutdown. These are valid points there are DEFINITELY downsides. 5. Around 18 he starts talking about the immune system. He talks about how the immune system needs to be exposed to pathogens to develop. ABSOLUTELY TRUE. But then he takes immunological development in a child to adults in quarantine. NOT TRUE. Unless you live inside a bubble, your home and your yard have TRILLIONS of pathogens. No amount of lysol and handwashing is going to remove pathogens that you breathe in and touch all the time. Your own mouth has billions of microbes. Your skin is teeming with microbes. Fungal spores and viruses in the air. Your immune system will 100% not be weaker by being at home. Your immune system might get weaker if you stay home, don't exercise and eat candy all day but the fact of being home in an of it self will not harm your immune system. 6. Around 26 minutes he says academics and reality are two different things. This appeals to some people but in this case, they need to go back to academics to learn basic statistics. 7. Around 27 minutes he talks about all the fomites you bring from costco to your house and totally contradicts his own point from 18 minutes (#5) 8. Around 28 he talks about the logical inconsistency for being able to go to costco but not to work or church. Because you're going to be interacting with people at either place. YES, ABSOLUTELY TRUE. Ideally, people should go nowhere. But we do need to eat and there's no other mechanism available to get food so they are letting what they consider \"essential\" continue. Now what's considered essential is up for debate since they've said liquor stores are essential which I personally disagree with but there is a logic in that. 9. Around 30, he claims doctors are being pressured to add covid to the diagnosis. That is definitely not happening at Loma LInda University or any other institution that I've spoken to. 10. Around the same time he talks about how covid doesn't kill people, their preexisting condition kills them. well we know for a fact that young healthy people have died. not often and definitely having poor health before makes you more likely to succumb. 11. Around 33. they said widespread testing is needed to open the economy. YUP. THAT'S WHAT EVERYONE IS SAYING. 12. Around 34, he says that covid and flu kill people. Completely contradicting himself from 3 minutes ago. 13. Around 37 he talks about quarantining the sick. YES, but no one knows who is infected or not right now and THAT is the biggest problem. 14. Around 41 minutes, they said that no one does in house testing. Actually every major hospital does in house testing. Loma Linda, USC, UCLA, Stanford, U of Washington, etc. 15. Around 45 minutes he talks about staying home if you have symptoms. Yes, but maybe he's not aware that people are infectious and shedding virus when they have no symptoms and a significant proportion NEVER get symptoms but are still spreading the virus. That's what makes covid-19 harder to get a handle on. If people didn't shed virus until AFTER they had symptoms it would be very easy. Just tell everyone to stay home once they get symptoms. problem solved. Unfortunately, this one transmits before symptoms are evident. 16. Around 47 they claim the virus will mutate and become less and less virulent. There is absolutely zero basis for that claim. None WHATSOEVER. It's possible that it will mutate and become less virulent but then that virus will be out-competed by the parental strain that is more virulent. It's also possible that it will mutate and become MORE virulent. There is no basis for which to say that a virus will mutate and become less virulent. 17. Around 48 minutes, they make a claim saying that academics haven't seen a patient in 20 years. That's not how academic medicine works. I see patients every day. And I see the patients that are too complex for the doctors in the community to deal with. 18. Around 50 minutes, they claim that wearing masks and gloves reduces your bacterial flora. You get your bacterial flora from the food you eat, the clothes you wear, the air you breathe. Wearing masks and gloves have minimal impact on that especially since most people take those things off once they get home. They also claim that they spoke to Kern County public health commissioner who agrees with them. That's not true either.",

        "content": "Okay, sooooo....during all of this fake Pandemic BS, I don't wear gloves all because I have enough brains to realize I'd have to change gloves every single time I touch one thing & then I touch another thing -- I know that cross contamination would happen with all the items I touched with the same friggin' gloves.\n\nI'm not wearing a face mask because... it is the perfect breeding ground for bacteria that can end up in your mouth & down into your lungs. I have learned that there are many harmful effects of rebreathing Carbon Dioxide (CO2). And CO2 is a gas the body naturally produces as WASTE. We breathe in oxygen (O2) to fuel organs & tissues & the end product is CO2. The balance between these two gases is required for a healthy body. However, when we rebreathe CO2 it can have harmful & sometimes very dangerous effects on the body. When CO2 levels are elevated in the body it is known as Hypercapnia. Hypercapnia can occur for a number of reasons, one of which is rebreathing our own exhaled CO2. Rebreathing CO2 can lead to increased blood pressure, headaches, muscle twitches, rapid heart rate, chest pain, confusion, & even fatigue. In extreme cases, if left untreated, Hypercapnia can lead to organ damage & sometimes even have long standing effects on the brain. UM. HELLO ~ Upper respiratory infection - anyone!? NO TO MASKS.\n\nI only do social distancing to a certain extent, all because I respect others personal space... but not because I'm afraid of my fellow Americans, friends or my neighbors. In fact, I would gladly hug a stranger right now - in public if it was a mutual feeling. Because hugging releases endorphins which uplifts your mood & it also relieves lots of stress... and well ~ there is a whole lotta' stress going on right now in this crazy @ss world.\n\nI have never, ever gotten the flu shot because I don't believe in injecting aluminum, formaldehyde, mercury, monkey cells & aborted fetus cells (just to name a few) directly into my body, blood, muscles. No way!!! AND - I also do not want to increase my chances of getting an upper respiratory illness including 4 strains of Coronavirus by 36%. NO THANKS!\n\nI will NOT be getting tested for Rona even if I show symptoms, because we have seen so many different stories all over the internet about the tests being contaminated with Coronavirus & now I see a cross contamination with HIV at this point. Plus, I already know they will label it Covid-19 without an actual test & I'll be added to the fake numbers that are increasing this panic all over something I may or may not truly have. I have heard from nurses themselves that say they would just tell me to go home & get some rest ...but seeeeeee, thing is -- I'm smart enough to stay home & away from people when sick or have symptoms of being sick.\n\nAND I know to wash my hands with soap & water because... well, that's just freakin' common sense.\n\nUM, I WILL NOT GET THE VACCINE! The government has never mandated a vaccine ever & I'll be damned if they force me put something in my body, that was created in less than 2 weeks of this \"outbreak\". I'm not a sheep, never will be a sheep & I refuse to be manipulated by the Gov. into thinking they have our best interest at hand. Riiiiiiiggghhht\ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nI believe in God. I know Jesus is my Savior. I will not live in fear, for I know that God is ultimately in control. So, if you want to stay in your house & never go out because you are \"doing the right thing\" that's fine, that's you, that ain't me though. I'm not going to let the media scare me into thinking this is some kind of mass Pandemic. That's what they want. They wanna shut this country down & here they are ~ doing it right in front of all of our faces. I will continue to go out & support locals as much as possible. I live in my life by \ud83d\ude4f Faith & not by fear.\n\nLook folks -- just start researching things. Open your eyes. Go watch:\n\"Out of Shadows\" \u2b07\ufe0f\u2b07\ufe0f\u2b07\ufe0f\u2b07\ufe0f\u2b07\ufe0f\n\nhttps://m.youtube.com/watch?feature=youtu.be&v=0wTiCxXgrJw\n\nYou now have all the time in the world. Please.... turn off the stupid TV & stop watching the news. Start researching from sources that have NO financial gain or conflict of interest. Then you will learn quite a bit. Then you will realize you've been lied to & manipulated your whole friggin' life.\n\nTake the blinders off \ud83d\udc40\nTIME TO WAKE UP from the deep sleep you are in!",

I will do this as safely as possible protecting my staff, myself and my guests with the measures we have put into place.\nI was raised with an understanding that providing sustenance to people is a holy thing and I will try to live up to my upbringing.\nI will not rely on my politicians.\nI will not rely on populist opinion.\nI will not rely on a bunch of stooges in masks with AR-15\u2019s taking our state houses hostage.\nI will not rely on ininformed selfish short sighted people that may need a haircut or a massage.\nI will rely on educated and informed scientists.\nI will rely on our medical professionals working to keep us as safe as possible.\nI will rely on unbiased informed data that will hopefully guide everyone in my industry to do their best.\nOne step at a time we will move forward, but with the information at hand, I believe it is too early to risk the health of my staff, myself, and my guests!",

Is it coincidence that just when the economy is booming, the stock market is setting record highs, we are winning the trade wars, school shootings have stopped and our nation is at peace and it looks like Trump is a sure bet for reelection after fending off 3 years of investigations and impeachment, then all the sudden world crisis pandemic. Stock market tumbles, companies are laying off employees, everything is closed and cancelled ect. Now they say there are a couple ways a President doesn't win reelection. Those are an unpopular war or a poor economy. I can't help but think there is something larger going on here driving this sudden outbreak right after Trump beats an impeachment. Especially the fact that it originated in China who we are in a global trade war with brought on by Trump. I am sure China doesn't want 4 more years of Trump either. I am not a conspiracy theorist but it all seems rather convenient for the nations and opponents of our current President and economy 5 months before an election. Couldn't have hit at a more perfect time. With the Democrats running out of campaign talking points in light of no school shootings, no migrant caravans at the southern border, fighting in Syria winding down, North Korea not firing missiles and Trump beating a sham impeachment. The corona virus gave them one last hail mary to try and point fingers at Trump with the clock winding down on 2020. This is almost the perfect fascist playbook. Control the population with fear mongering and panic, control the media and propaganda, and the fan favorite disarm the population. I guess I am a skeptic. Sorry but I don't think we are all going to die. Remember when Ebola was what was going to kill us all, and the media kept showing the piles of body bags that were prepared for the fallout. Then a month later it was totally forgotten. I wish people could just go about their lives until this plays out. I'll worry when there is a significant death toll like nearing a million or something. A handful of deaths out of 320 million Americans and we are in panic tearing down our society and costing our economy billions in the wake. It all just seems fishy, a little too well timed if you ask me. Call me cynical all you want. FLU, SARS, MERS, EBOLA, AVIAN FLU, SWINE\ufffc\ufffc FLU, a second round of\ufffc EBOLA..........And none of those\ufffc caused any one of the number of things that\u2019s happening currently.\ufffc..........",

He hasn't a chance in hell & they're not about to let an outsider(Bernie) destroy their scheme.\nIt looks like Trump is a sure bet for reelection after fending off 3 years of investigations and impeachment, then all the sudden world crisis pandemic.

We have alternative options if needed. Here\u2019s a statement from Doctor Levin. \u201cWhat I would like to say to those people who interpreted what I said as forcibly pulling people from their homes if they become COVID positive is that if I conveyed that, it was a mistake on my part and I apologize for that. I am sensitive to that as well. We have no intention of taking people from the environments they feel safe and comfortable in. To demonstrate our past actions, because they speak louder than words, we have managed over 600 people in our county with COVID-19 and we have not forcibly removed anyone from their home or wherever they wanted to be. We have removed about 7 of our seniors who were living in Long Term Care Facilities (LTCF) and had them admitted to one of our hospitals. This was to protect the other seniors and to observe those hospitalized for worsening of their symptoms. If COVID establishes itself in a LTCF (a nursing home), it can kill dozens as it did in Washington State. We also placed two homeless people who were COVID positive in a motel because they wanted to return to a crowded camp in the river bottom. Virtually everyone wants to stay in their home. It is safest when such a person can have their own room and bathroom but many of our COVID cases have not been so fortunate. When that is the case, our Communicable Disease nurses find ways of keeping them in their home such that it is still safe for the others who are there.\u201d - Doctor Robert Levin, Public Health Officer County of Ventura. https://vcportal.ventura.org/covid19/docs/VCMC_Ambulatory_Instructions_COVID_Diagnosis.pdf",

Instead, it is spreading in a country like Switzerland, in the same way it is spreading in the desert areas. Whereas if it were natural, it would have spread in cold places, but died in hot places.\n\nI have done 40 years of research on animals and viruses. It is not natural. It is manufactured and the virus is completely artificial. I have worked for 4 years in the Wuhan laboratory in China. I am fully acquainted with all the staff of that laboratory. I have been phoning them all, after the Coronavirus surfaced. But all their phones are dead for the last 3 months. It is now understood that all these lab technicians have died.\n\nBased on all my knowledge and research till date, I can say this with 100% confidence - That the Coronavirus is not natural. It did not come from bats. China manufactured it. If what I am saying today is proved false now or even after my death, the government can withdraw my Nobel Prize. China is lying and this truth will one day be revealed to everyone\".\n\nFOOD FOR THOUGHT!",

        "content": "OK, since this video by Drs. Erickson and Massihi has been making the rounds on facebook, I feel like I need to respond. Now first of all, I actually agree with the basic premise that this is not as dangerous as we first thought and we should probably move to open. However they make many false and misleading claims so I feel like I need to respond. This video is I believe making the rounds because it sounds internally logical and has many facts that are either deliberately or inadvertantly misinterpreted and about 95% of the things they are saying are true and then there's the 5% that's the gotcha. So let's go through it point by point. 1. at around the 3 minute mark, he says that we should quarantine the people that are sick and not the people that are well. ABSOLUTELY CORRECT. However in order to quarantine the sick and not the well, you need to know who is sick and who is well. That's the problem with Covid-19 is that unlike measles or most other infectious diseases, people can spread the disease when they are asymptomatic so how do you know who needs to be quarantined and who doesn't? Ideally, you do what South Korea did and have lots of testing available and you test everyone and then you trace all their contacts and test them and now you know who has the virus and who doesn't and you quarantine those who have the virus and let the others go about their business. We did not have testing and we still do not have enough testing to test everyone. so what do you do when you don't know who has the virus? yeah, you quarantine everyone. 2. around the 4 minute mark, they say that they had 340 out of 5213 tests positive (6.5%). Then they talk about how 12% of the tests in california were positive and 39% of the tests in new york were positive. Then they say that Ca has 39 million people and 12% of them being positive means 4.5 million people have covid-19. THIS IS THE SINGLE GREATEST PROBLEM WITH THIS VIDEO. Either they are being purposely misleading or they completely forgot statistics 101. They are confusing testing within a high pretest probability cohort with a random sample of the population that can be extrapolated to the general population. Let me explain. Until now, the way covid testing worked was that there were so few tests that we only tested people that we were pretty sure had the disease. And even if we were pretty sure they had the disease, if they had mild symptoms, we didn't test them. Therefore the tested samples will have a much higher rate of positivity than the general population. This kind of thought process would be like I run an emergency room and tonight 10% of the people have a stroke. Then I extrapolate that to mean that 10% of the world is having a stroke tonight. That's obviously ludicrous. The sample of people coming to the ER is not representative of the entire population. There are currently random testing studies being done to look at prevalence in the general population and I've discussed them and they think the prevalence is about 2-3 percent. These are early studies and still should not be used to extrapolate nationwide and have problems dealing with bayesian probability and testing specificity but are FAR FAR better than using testing data in a hospital setting to the population. That's just plain wrong. He keeps saying he's following the science and using data. The problem is that he doesn't understand data and is misinterpreting it and is NOT following the science. 3. Around 13 minutes, they discuss Norway and Sweden. Sweden has 1,765 deaths. Norway has 182 deaths. He claims this is statistically insignificant. I have no idea what statistical test he used and I'm pretty sure he has no idea either because he didn't do one. The correct test to do would be a chi squared test with Yates correction. That gives a P value of <0.0001. That's about as statistically significant as it gets! In fact, you don't even need to do a statistical test on it. Sweden has 10 times the deaths as Norway. No one looks at a ten fold increase and says \"BAH, that's nothing!\" 4. Around 16 minutes he talks about the downsides of the shutdown. These are valid points there are DEFINITELY downsides. 5. Around 18 he starts talking about the immune system. He talks about how the immune system needs to be exposed to pathogens to develop. ABSOLUTELY TRUE. But then he takes immunological development in a child to adults in quarantine. NOT TRUE. Unless you live inside a bubble, your home and your yard have TRILLIONS of pathogens. No amount of lysol and handwashing is going to remove pathogens that you breathe in and touch all the time. Your own mouth has billions of microbes. Your skin is teeming with microbes. Fungal spores and viruses in the air. Your immune system will 100% not be weaker by being at home. Your immune system might get weaker if you stay home, don't exercise and eat candy all day but the fact of being home in an of it self will not harm your immune system. 6. Around 26 minutes he says academics and reality are two different things. This appeals to some people but in this case, they need to go back to academics to learn basic statistics. 7. Around 27 minutes he talks about all the fomites you bring from costco to your house and totally contradicts his own point from 18 minutes (#5) 8. Around 28 he talks about the logical inconsistency for being able to go to costco but not to work or church. Because you're going to be interacting with people at either place. YES, ABSOLUTELY TRUE. Ideally, people should go nowhere. But we do need to eat and there's no other mechanism available to get food so they are letting what they consider \"essential\" continue. Now what's considered essential is up for debate since they've said liquor stores are essential which I personally disagree with but there is a logic in that. 9. Around 30, he claims doctors are being pressured to add covid to the diagnosis. That is definitely not happening at Loma LInda University or any other institution that I've spoken to. 10. Around the same time he talks about how covid doesn't kill people, their preexisting condition kills them. well we know for a fact that young healthy people have died. not often and definitely having poor health before makes you more likely to succumb. 11. Around 33. they said widespread testing is needed to open the economy. YUP. THAT'S WHAT EVERYONE IS SAYING. 12. Around 34, he says that covid and flu kill people. Completely contradicting himself from 3 minutes ago. 13. Around 37 he talks about quarantining the sick. YES, but no one knows who is infected or not right now and THAT is the biggest problem. 14. Around 41 minutes, they said that no one does in house testing. Actually every major hospital does in house testing. Loma Linda, USC, UCLA, Stanford, U of Washington, etc. 15. Around 45 minutes he talks about staying home if you have symptoms. Yes, but maybe he's not aware that people are infectious and shedding virus when they have no symptoms and a significant proportion NEVER get symptoms but are still spreading the virus. That's what makes covid-19 harder to get a handle on. If people didn't shed virus until AFTER they had symptoms it would be very easy. Just tell everyone to stay home once they get symptoms. problem solved. Unfortunately, this one transmits before symptoms are evident. 16. Around 47 they claim the virus will mutate and become less and less virulent. There is absolutely zero basis for that claim. None WHATSOEVER. It's possible that it will mutate and become less virulent but then that virus will be out-competed by the parental strain that is more virulent. It's also possible that it will mutate and become MORE virulent. There is no basis for which to say that a virus will mutate and become less virulent. 17. Around 48 minutes, they make a claim saying that academics haven't seen a patient in 20 years. That's not how academic medicine works. I see patients every day. And I see the patients that are too complex for the doctors in the community to deal with. 18. Around 50 minutes, they claim that wearing masks and gloves reduces your bacterial flora. You get your bacterial flora from the food you eat, the clothes you wear, the air you breathe. Wearing masks and gloves have minimal impact on that especially since most people take those things off once they get home. They also claim that they spoke to Kern County public health commissioner who agrees with them. That's not true either.",

        "content": "OK, since this video by Drs. Erickson and Massihi has been making the rounds on facebook, I feel like I need to respond. Now first of all, I actually agree with the basic premise that this is not as dangerous as we first thought and we should probably move to open. However they make many false and misleading claims so I feel like I need to respond. This video is I believe making the rounds because it sounds internally logical and has many facts that are either deliberately or inadvertantly misinterpreted and about 95% of the things they are saying are true and then there's the 5% that's the gotcha. So let's go through it point by point. 1. at around the 3 minute mark, he says that we should quarantine the people that are sick and not the people that are well. ABSOLUTELY CORRECT. However in order to quarantine the sick and not the well, you need to know who is sick and who is well. That's the problem with Covid-19 is that unlike measles or most other infectious diseases, people can spread the disease when they are asymptomatic so how do you know who needs to be quarantined and who doesn't? Ideally, you do what South Korea did and have lots of testing available and you test everyone and then you trace all their contacts and test them and now you know who has the virus and who doesn't and you quarantine those who have the virus and let the others go about their business. We did not have testing and we still do not have enough testing to test everyone. so what do you do when you don't know who has the virus? yeah, you quarantine everyone. 2. around the 4 minute mark, they say that they had 340 out of 5213 tests positive (6.5%). Then they talk about how 12% of the tests in california were positive and 39% of the tests in new york were positive. Then they say that Ca has 39 million people and 12% of them being positive means 4.5 million people have covid-19. THIS IS THE SINGLE GREATEST PROBLEM WITH THIS VIDEO. Either they are being purposely misleading or they completely forgot statistics 101. They are confusing testing within a high pretest probability cohort with a random sample of the population that can be extrapolated to the general population. Let me explain. Until now, the way covid testing worked was that there were so few tests that we only tested people that we were pretty sure had the disease. And even if we were pretty sure they had the disease, if they had mild symptoms, we didn't test them. Therefore the tested samples will have a much higher rate of positivity than the general population. This kind of thought process would be like I run an emergency room and tonight 10% of the people have a stroke. Then I extrapolate that to mean that 10% of the world is having a stroke tonight. That's obviously ludicrous. The sample of people coming to the ER is not representative of the entire population. There are currently random testing studies being done to look at prevalence in the general population and I've discussed them and they think the prevalence is about 2-3 percent. These are early studies and still should not be used to extrapolate nationwide and have problems dealing with bayesian probability and testing specificity but are FAR FAR better than using testing data in a hospital setting to the population. That's just plain wrong. He keeps saying he's following the science and using data. The problem is that he doesn't understand data and is misinterpreting it and is NOT following the science. 3. Around 13 minutes, they discuss Norway and Sweden. Sweden has 1,765 deaths. Norway has 182 deaths. He claims this is statistically insignificant. I have no idea what statistical test he used and I'm pretty sure he has no idea either because he didn't do one. The correct test to do would be a chi squared test with Yates correction. That gives a P value of <0.0001. That's about as statistically significant as it gets! In fact, you don't even need to do a statistical test on it. Sweden has 10 times the deaths as Norway. No one looks at a ten fold increase and says \"BAH, that's nothing!\" 4. Around 16 minutes he talks about the downsides of the shutdown. These are valid points there are DEFINITELY downsides. 5. Around 18 he starts talking about the immune system. He talks about how the immune system needs to be exposed to pathogens to develop. ABSOLUTELY TRUE. But then he takes immunological development in a child to adults in quarantine. NOT TRUE. Unless you live inside a bubble, your home and your yard have TRILLIONS of pathogens. No amount of lysol and handwashing is going to remove pathogens that you breathe in and touch all the time. Your own mouth has billions of microbes. Your skin is teeming with microbes. Fungal spores and viruses in the air. Your immune system will 100% not be weaker by being at home. Your immune system might get weaker if you stay home, don't exercise and eat candy all day but the fact of being home in an of it self will not harm your immune system. 6.

        "content": "From the beginning I thought this to be a weaponized virus. In the very least, the Democrats have certainly used it politically. Can't trust them, or Communist totalitarians. Written by Bill O'Reilly China\u2019s Bio weapon, and Pelosi.. My wife Angie will tell you that I study history and world events fluently every day. I have studied China for many years. To get answers I need to questions, I call many I know in Washington on Capitol Hill (from my tenure on two Presidential campaigns and Presidential talks) and I ask them for straight up answers to better understand what affects us as a nation. Well, in 2016 America elected a new Sheriff: Donald J Trump. For decades the Chinese walked all over America but the new President said \u201cnot anymore\u201d. Trump literally strangled China\u2019s economy to the point their economy was in its worst free fall ever. Trump negotiated a new 50 billion trade agreement. He had Xi by the proverbial balls. America\u2019s economy was on fire and unstoppable. President Xi Jingping knew he could not beat the USA militarily and he knew any domesticated economic attack would fail as our economy was too strong. He had to act. But how? Enter the USA democrats led by Pelosi and Schiff. Impeachment. A hoax. A distraction for our people and President. Xi Jingping and his thugs see this. They aren\u2019t stupid. They have very intelligent intellectual thinkers in their government. Now you must understand , the Chinese regime are truly Barbarians. Notice I did not say ALL CHINESE. The Chinese people are a good people. I enjoy my interactions with them. The communist regime has millions of its own citizens slaving in gulags simply for speaking against the government or openly practicing Christianity. Knowing they could not attack us openly they needed to be coy, like a deceptive fox. In my opinion, I believe the regime released a biological weapon upon the world that doesn\u2019t kill everyone, but kills \u201cenough,\u201d especially the elderly and in-firmed. Back in WW 2 Hitler thought the same way. He got rid of what he considered the useless and rejects of society. Trumps task force uses models to figure things. Xi used and uses \u201cmodels\u201d too. China's president figured that if he killed a few of his own (a few hundred thousand to them would be a few out of 1.4 billion people) and spread the virus to other nations (especially to the USA) they would \u201clevel the economic playing field\u201d and not have fired a shot. Losses of his own people were acceptable costs of a new war. When China\u2019s own doctors attempted to sound the warning, they were immediately silenced. In fact one died and another has simply disappeared. Trump and the other allied leaders indeed KNOW this is what happened. They have under reported their own deaths. Trump knows he cannot outrightly seek retribution. His news conference today showed me this when he balked publicly about no outright retribution over Xi\u2019s handling of this and he immediately brought up the \u201ctrade deal\u201d. However, Trump wasn\u2019t being weak, he too was now being coy. We know this was a biological weapon. The food market story is bullshit. Xi knows we know it. Trump also today announced he sent two battle groups of destroyers and other ships to sea several days ago to fight drugs and rogue actors like Iran should they try anything. I say he did this to show Xi he knows what has transpired (we have the greatest intelligence assets) and that they (the Chinese) should rethink further action. Politics is premier. We cannot overtly attack China for what they have done as we would also suffer greatly. We all know this. But China has temporarily achieved its goal. America was literally consumed by Trumps phony impeachment brought by the ultra left democrats (supported by democrat rank and file and one Republican Mitt Romney) and Xi Jingping saw an opening. He took it. Xi did what Trump usually does...he walked onto the world stage and threw a grenade into the \u201croom\u201d and left. It exploded in the form of this worldwide pandemic. It brought the USA and the rest of the world to its knees and leveled the economic playing field. Our economy is now near depression. Xi didn\u2019t fire one bullet. Trump needed to up his game of chess and putting our Naval ships to sea was his next move. He said he is a \u201cwar\u201d President. He is. But now on not one but two fronts. One front is the virus and the other front is the Chinese. While the Saudi\u2019s and Russians are screwing with oil prices they aren\u2019t overtly doing what this pandemic is doing. The drug smuggling story for dispatching the Naval Force is bullshit and the world knows it. I am of the opinion Trump can indeed bring us back from this catastrophe albeit with a changed playing field. But Trump is a genius in chess and financial matters. He\u2019s become a champ at international politics too. I am sure Trump can once again lead the economy to even stronger strength and greatness the it was . He can do it quickly I\u2019m sure of it. He has proved it. Xi Jingping needs to be sent a message loud and clear. NEVER AGAIN. We need to bring all of our critical manufacturing back from China beginning with our medicines they were recently threatening to withhold. We can do it immediately. Again, another reason for Trump putting to sea such a sizable Naval Force. Sending a clear message. We all must ride out the next few weeks. Then we and the world pick up the pieces and move on. The democrats who have given Xi this opening wrapped in a bow must pay a heavy price in November as they (the democrats) truly have cost and continue to cost America precious lives by the phony scandals. Nancy Pelosi continues to help the Chinese by her daily shameless attacks upon the President and meddling in stimulus packages as she did this last weekend. Yesterday\u2019s statements she made were truly appalling and the lowest of low. I didn\u2019t think she could go any lower. What a disgrace she is to our nation. But, Pelosi aside, make no mistake, China must and will be taught a lesson the likes they have never seen before and Trump is the man to pull the trigger. We the people must teach the democrats the same lesson at the polls. They (the radical wing of the party) are the enemy of a free America. I am certain of it. The entire democrat party of our forefathers is dead. Remember people, Trump indeed tried to warn us all of the Conavirus in his State of the Union Speech. He spoke of it. He said he was on top of it. After he spoke , Nancy Pelosi ripped up the speech calling Trumps words \u201ca manifesto of lies\u201d. She disgraced the country and all of our fellow honored citizens present in the House Chamber. Well she now has American blood on her hands. She is very majorly responsible for these needless deaths as well as the Chinese. Her and Adam Schiff. The left and democrats laughed as she tore up his speech. Well, as they laughed the disease he just spoke of in that speech came to our shores. Republicans and Democrats alike are now dying. Your family members and mine. Our grandparents and middle aged citizens alike. Bodies are being loaded in trucks with forklifts in Brooklyn outside of hospitals. No one is safe. Our liberty is for the most part suspended. As we bury our dead (without proper funerals) from this calamity let\u2019s drive the nails into the coffin of the Democrat party as well in November. It\u2019s time people. Stand up for your rights and your country! Our Liberty and survival is at stake! I am praying for God\u2019s blessing on our nation. But, God also gave us the ability to think for ourselves and it\u2019s time we placed blame for all this death where it belongs: on the doorsteps of Nancy Pelosi, Adam Schiff and Xi Jingping directly. Wake Up America. WAKE UP!",

Trump literally strangled China\u2019s economy to the point their economy was in its worst free fall ever. Trump negotiated a new 50 billion trade agreement. He had Xi by the proverbial balls. America\u2019s economy was on fire and unstoppable. President Xi Jingping knew he could not beat the USA militarily and he knew any domesticated economic attack would fail as our economy was too strong. He had to act. But how? Enter the USA democrats led by Pelosi and Schiff. Impeachment. A hoax. A distraction for our people and President. Xi Jingping and his thugs see this. They aren\u2019t stupid. They have very intelligent intellectual thinkers in their government. Now you must understand , the Chinese regime are truly Barbarians. Notice I did not say ALL CHINESE. The Chinese people are a good people. I enjoy my interactions with them. The communist regime has millions of its own citizens slaving in gulags simply for speaking against the government or openly practicing Christianity. Knowing they could not attack us openly they needed to be coy, like a deceptive fox. In my opinion, I believe the regime released a biological weapon upon the world that doesn\u2019t kill everyone, but kills \u201cenough,\u201d especially the elderly and in-firmed. Back in WW 2 Hitler thought the same way. He got rid of what he considered the useless and rejects of society. Trumps task force uses models to figure things. Xi used and uses \u201cmodels\u201d too. China's president figured that if he killed a few of his own (a few hundred thousand to them would be a few out of 1.4 billion people) and spread the virus to other nations (especially to the USA) they would \u201clevel the economic playing field\u201d and not have fired a shot. Losses of his own people were acceptable costs of a new war. When China\u2019s own doctors attempted to sound the warning, they were immediately silenced. In fact one died and another has simply disappeared. Trump and the other allied leaders indeed KNOW this is what happened. They have under reported their own deaths. Trump knows he cannot outrightly seek retribution. His news conference today showed me this when he balked publicly about no outright retribution over Xi\u2019s handling of this and he immediately brought up the \u201ctrade deal\u201d. However, Trump wasn\u2019t being weak, he too was now being coy. We know this was a biological weapon. The food market story is bullshit. Xi knows we know it. Trump also today announced he sent two battle groups of destroyers and other ships to sea several days ago to fight drugs and rogue actors like Iran should they try anything. I say he did this to show Xi he knows what has transpired (we have the greatest intelligence assets) and that they (the Chinese) should rethink further action. Politics is premier. We cannot overtly attack China for what they have done as we would also suffer greatly. We all know this. But China has temporarily achieved its goal. America was literally consumed by Trumps phony impeachment brought by the ultra left democrats (supported by democrat rank and file and one Republican Mitt Romney) and Xi Jingping saw an opening. He took it. Xi did what Trump usually does...he walked onto the world stage and threw a grenade into the \u201croom\u201d and left. It exploded in the form of this worldwide pandemic. It brought the USA and the rest of the world to its knees and leveled the economic playing field. Our economy is now near depression. Xi didn\u2019t fire one bullet. Trump needed to up his game of chess and putting our Naval ships to sea was his next move. He said he is a \u201cwar\u201d President. He is. But now on not one but two fronts. One front is the virus and the other front is the Chinese. While the Saudi\u2019s and Russians are screwing with oil prices they aren\u2019t overtly doing what this pandemic is doing. The drug smuggling story for dispatching the Naval Force is bullshit and the world knows it. I am of the opinion Trump can indeed bring us back from this catastrophe albeit with a changed playing field. But Trump is a genius in chess and financial matters. He\u2019s become a champ at international politics too. I am sure Trump can once again lead the economy to even stronger strength and greatness the it was . He can do it quickly I\u2019m sure of it. He has proved it. Xi Jingping needs to be sent a message loud and clear. NEVER AGAIN. We need to bring all of our critical manufacturing back from China beginning with our medicines they were recently threatening to withhold. We can do it immediately. Again, another reason for Trump putting to sea such a sizable Naval Force. Sending a clear message. We all must ride out the next few weeks. Then we and the world pick up the pieces and move on. The democrats who have given Xi this opening wrapped in a bow must pay a heavy price in November as they (the democrats) truly have cost and continue to cost America precious lives by the phony scandals. Nancy Pelosi continues to help the Chinese by her daily shameless attacks upon the President and meddling in stimulus packages as she did this last weekend. Yesterday\u2019s statements she made were truly appalling and the lowest of low. I didn\u2019t think she could go any lower. What a disgrace she is to our nation. But, Pelosi aside, make no mistake, China must and will be taught a lesson the likes they have never seen before and Trump is the man to pull the trigger. We the people must teach the democrats the same lesson at the polls. They (the radical wing of the party) are the enemy of a free America. I am certain of it. The entire democrat party of our forefathers is dead. Remember people, Trump indeed tried to warn us all of the Conavirus in his State of the Union Speech. He spoke of it. He said he was on top of it. After he spoke , Nancy Pelosi ripped up the speech calling Trumps words \u201ca manifesto of lies\u201d. She disgraced the country and all of our fellow honored citizens present in the House Chamber. Well she now has American blood on her hands. She is very majorly responsible for these needless deaths as well as the Chinese. Her and Adam Schiff. The left and democrats laughed as she tore up his speech. Well, as they laughed the disease he just spoke of in that speech came to our shores. Republicans and Democrats alike are now dying. Your family members and mine. Our grandparents and middle aged citizens alike. Bodies are being loaded in trucks with forklifts in Brooklyn outside of hospitals. No one is safe. Our liberty is for the most part suspended. As we bury our dead (without proper funerals) from this calamity let\u2019s drive the nails into the coffin of the Democrat party as well in November. It\u2019s time people. Stand up for your rights and your country! Our Liberty and survival is at stake! I am praying for God\u2019s blessing on our nation. But, God also gave us the ability to think for ourselves and it\u2019s time we placed blame for all this death where it belongs: on the doorsteps of Nancy Pelosi, Adam Schiff and Xi Jingping directly. Wake Up America. WAKE UP!",

They left their small kids ( cara and lia) with their grandparents after coronavirus outbreak in Italy and spent day and night working at the hospital. Since then, they never saw their kids to avoid the chances of getting them infected . While treating the patients with the virus, Antonio got infected with the virus, but this didn\u2019t break the determination of Susan to help the patients, neither did Antonio stop her from working in the hospital. They kept their duty higher than their family obligations. A week later Sofia also got infected with the virus, and the hospital was out of beds and isolation wards. Sofia had some medical conditions, so the chances of her recovery were feeble. They kept themselves in isolation. Days later, they got a call from hospital that they have a bed for one patient. Antonio insisted Sofia to get admitted , but she didn\u2019t want to leave her husband to die in vain. Few days later they both died holding each others hand, looking after each other, caressing each other. They never got a chance to hug their kids for a final goodbye.\nCara and lia lost their parents.\nThe couple lost each other.\nHospital lost patriotic nurses.\nBut we people lost compassion, lost our minds\n\nThese brave people are risking their life to save the lives of stupid people like us , who are not listening to them and roaming out freely on roads. If we stayed home, we could stop the spread. We could have saved parents of lia and cara, we could have saved Sofia and Antonio and many other unknown heroes.\n\n#stayhome #havemercy\n\nThe above picture was taken while they were working in hospital, few days before Antonio got infected, unaware that this might be their last kiss.",

Let's remain vigilant and on our guard. Here are some pages where you can get reliable, transparent information:\nMissouri Department of Health and Senior Services\nMissouri Department of Public Safety\nMissouri State Emergency Management Agency\nMissouri Department of Elementary and Secondary Education\nMissouri Department of Higher Education & Workforce Development\nMissouri Department of Economic Development\nMissouri Department of Labor and Industrial Relations\nMissouri Veterans Commission\nMissouri State Highway Patrol This fake letter is circulating on social media, saying DESE will not allow students to move on to the next grade level for the 2020-2021 school year because #COVID19 caused school closures and statewide required assessments to be cancelled.\n\u27a1\ufe0f That is simply not true. \u2b05\ufe0f\nWe could not be more disappointed that someone chose to use their free time to create this document, illegally using our department logo, and make a joke about something as serious as our students' education. This is particularly insensitive given the anxiety and uncertainty so many students and families are dealing with right now.",

They are closing liquor stores... Next will be banks... Then our phones will stop working...they don't want venues of 50 or more people because theywould have more trouble trying to control 50+people... Somethings not right here and everyone is dumb enough to think it's really just a virus...the numbers are nothing compared to h1n1 or Ebola ... Everyone need to realize our government is up to something and we are dumb enough to believe what you see on TV or on Facebook... Everyone better stock up on defense supplies because that toilet paper isn't going to protect you when they come",

        "content": "Right before corona virus came... CEO of disney stepped down CEO of Tinder, Hinge, OKcupid, Match all stepped down CEO of Hulu stepped down CEO of MedMen stepped down CEO of L brands like Victoria Secret bath and body works stepped down CEO of Salesforce's stepped down CEO of Harley Davidson stepped down CEO of IBM stepped down CEO of T Mobile stepping down CEO of LinkedIn stepping down CEO of Mastercard is stepping down And soooooo many more, but let's just stick with these that most know about. Weird they stepped down right before \"Corona Virus scare\" almost like they all knew it was coming \ud83e\udd14\ud83e\udd14 Following it stocks seen their biggest crash in recorded history, worse than great depression or the early 2000s hit, crypto markets started following suit. And governments are shutting things down left and right. \"Corona virus omg!\" This was a planned epidemic that needed a face to it for the masses to follow it blindly like the blind sheep the majority is. This was planned for decades in advance with many short \"scares\" coming like Ebola and the countless other \"epidemics\" to prepare the human mind for the grand finale \"CoronaVirus\" omg! It is nothing more than a face. \"But cody! All the governments are on it!\" The world is all a 1 world government for the major part, you just been to blind to see it. This is larger than an attack on the elections This is larger than an attack on china as a global manufacturing hub. This is larger than an attack on a single economy like the united states who just entered their largest economic collapse that will make the great depression look like a joke. This is the forced introduction into a new era. The online world. Following this will be mass closures of brick and mortar stores The largest housing market collapse to date. A huge shift in power and money on a global scale. The largest lay off of jobs, because they have been a scam for so long, now they are finally going away. This is all to make room for the largest influx of automation coming. Malls will turn into warehouses and shipping facilities. Big department stores as well. This is the rise of virtual sports and the first test of a mass market of it. Virtual reality is about to be massively introduced. This is a massive shift off offline to online. Of manual labor to automation. \"Omg corona virus!\" Keep thinking that. Your the first to go when this mass extinction comes, because it is coming. Homeless rates will hit all time highs. Foreclosures will hit all time highs. Lay offs will hit all time highs. Stores will run out of food and necessities. Those who didnt prepare for this wont get help as there wont be anything to help them with. America will be hit hardest, because americans well... let's face it, some of the laziest people on planet earth, just facts. They dont prepare they just react, and reacting wont help you in this case. If you dont already have automated income, work from home stuff going, and I mean work from home for yourself, not a company, in other words, your not collecting a paycheck, then your too late and better start finding anway online get it and learn it because it will be your best bet. You can see this as the worlds largest economic collapse, you would be right. Nothing will compare to thos one. You can see this as the begining of world war 3, you are probably right on that, but it wont look anything like world war 1 or 2, it is done much differently with media control, fear introduction, and using \"the people\" as the weapon. Control the people, control anything u want. And media has conditioned people to not be able to think for themselves for this exact moment. You can see this as the next black plague and your probably right, but it wont have to do with corona virus again. It's just the face of this. I could make this post go on forever. But let's keep it at that. Share this, wake up, now is not the time to play games, to take a break, to sit at home. No one is safe from what is to come, and that is why the CEOs stepped down, they know it's time to prepare for something much bigger than themselves and had warning before any of us. The elite always have the upper hand. Share this. And let's wake up to what is truly happening Prepare For The Storm Q\n\"Here is some inside info you won't hear on the news: This morning, at 4:30AM, our\u2026 More  ",

China was the first to have over 100,000 5G towers, and people in Wuhan were the first to get affected by it. This 5G shit was planned years ago to depopulate us and keep as at a low vibrational state. Bill gates is the one who created this along with the weird entities who control this world. He also is creating a vaccine for this so called corona virus that they are going to try to enforce on everyone. These Vaccines are actually chips that they are trying to implant in billions of people across the world. They can literally monitor all ya actions, movements, whereabouts, and thoughts through these lil micro chips. Not only that they can end ya life through them micro chips with the push of a button. They know in order to have millions of people take these vaccines they first need to create a fake virus. Smh it grinds my fuckin gears that you humans are brainwashed enough to believe wtf the news and media puts out there. WAKE TF UP and start researching the truths behind these weird agendas they keep creating. Y\u2019all really out there with masks and shit on WHEN IT AINT NO DAMN VIRUSSSSSS. These Chinese doctors and people you see on TV that\u2019s so called affected by the virus ARE ALL ACTORS, this shit is scripted out LITERALLY. It\u2019s 5G towers that\u2019s killing people and no mask in the world can prevent them levels of radiation from frying your brain. If we don\u2019t wake tf up NOW this shit finna really kill us smh \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f but of course y\u2019all gonna think I\u2019m crazy for saying this too right ???

The CDC isn\u2019t charging for coronavirus testing but patients could be stuck with associated costs, such as a trip to the emergency room. In Florida, a man who worried he was infected initially faced a $3,270 bill even though he never received a coronavirus test. The man was charged for other costs incurred when he went to the hospital because he was worried he was infected. The biggest was his co-pay for the emergency room visit, which cost him $819.",

So it's origins could be varied but it's definitely not the fault of animal.\nIf it's China there is possibility that they let it out to stop the eating of animals. Believe don't count it out with the way they are bashed & we know their are some that would do something this sick.\n\nI like the fact the viruses I've mentioned before have all been mentioned here & I'll add extra content to support via the comments section.",

        "content": "What is the Corona/ Covid-19 Virus Really Teaching us? I\u2019m a strong believer that there is a spiritual purpose behind everything that happens, whether that is what we perceive as being good or being bad. As I meditate upon this, I want to share with you what I feel the Corona/ Covid-19 virus is really doing to us: - It is reminding us that we are all equal, regardless of our culture, religion, occupation, financial situation or how famous we are. This disease treats us all equally, perhaps we should to. If you don\u2019t believe me, just ask Tom Hanks. - It is reminding us that we are all connected and something that affects one person has an effect on another. It is reminding us that the false borders that we have put up have little value as this virus does not need a passport. It is reminding us, by oppressing us for a short time, of those in this world whose whole life is spent in oppression. - It is reminding us of how precious our health is and how we have moved to neglect it through eating nutrient poor manufactured food and drinking water that is contaminated with chemicals upon chemicals. If we don\u2019t look after our health, we will, of course, get sick. - It is reminding us of the shortness of life and of what is most important for us to do, which is to help each other, especially those who are old or sick. Our purpose is not to buy toilet roll. - It is reminding us of how materialistic our society has become and how, when in times of difficulty, we remember that it\u2019s the essentials that we need (food, water, medicine) as opposed to the luxuries that we sometimes unnecessarily give value to. - It is reminding us of how important our family and home life is and how much we have neglected this. It is forcing us back into our houses so we can rebuild them into our home and to strengthen our family unit. - It is reminding us that our true work is not our job, that is what we do, not what we were created to do. Our true work is to look after each other, to protect each other and to be of benefit to one another. - It is reminding us to keep our egos in check. It is reminding us that no matter how great we think we are or how great others think we are, a virus can bring our world to a standstill. - It is reminding us that the power of freewill is in our hands. We can choose to cooperate and help each other, to share, to give, to help and to support each other or we can choose to be selfish, to hoard, to look after only our self. Indeed, it is difficulties that bring out our true colours. - It is reminding us that we can be patient, or we can panic. We can either understand that this type of situation has happened many times before in history and will pass, or we can panic and see it as the end of the world and, consequently, cause ourselves more harm than good. - It is reminding us that this can either be an end or a new beginning. This can be a time of reflection and understanding, where we learn from our mistakes, or it can be the start of a cycle which will continue until we finally learn the lesson we are meant to. - It is reminding us that the true heroes are not the movie stars or sports stars that we put on a pedestal, but the doctors, nurses, care-workers etc. that dedicate their lives to helping people on a daily basis. - It is reminding us that this Earth is sick. It is reminding us that we need to look at the rate of deforestation just as urgently as we look at the speed at which toilet rolls are disappearing off of shelves. We are sick because our home is sick. - It is reminding us that after every difficulty, there is always ease. Life is cyclical, and this is just a phase in this great cycle. We do not need to panic; this too shall pass. Whereas many see the Corona/ Covid-19 virus as a great disaster, I prefer to see it as a great corrector. It is sent to remind us of the important lessons that we seem to have forgotten and it is up to us if we will learn them or not.",

        "content": "What is the Corona/ Covid-19 Virus Really Teaching us? I\u2019m a strong believer that there is a spiritual purpose behind everything that happens, whether that is what we perceive as being good or being bad. As I meditate upon this, I want to share with you what I feel the Corona/ Covid-19 virus is really doing to us: - It is reminding us that we are all equal, regardless of our culture, religion, occupation, financial situation or how famous we are. This disease treats us all equally, perhaps we should to. If you don\u2019t believe me, just ask Tom Hanks. - It is reminding us that we are all connected and something that affects one person has an effect on another. It is reminding us that the false borders that we have put up have little value as this virus does not need a passport. It is reminding us, by oppressing us for a short time, of those in this world whose whole life is spent in oppression. - It is reminding us of how precious our health is and how we have moved to neglect it through eating nutrient poor manufactured food and drinking water that is contaminated with chemicals upon chemicals. If we don\u2019t look after our health, we will, of course, get sick. - It is reminding us of the shortness of life and of what is most important for us to do, which is to help each other, especially those who are old or sick. Our purpose is not to buy toilet roll. - It is reminding us of how materialistic our society has become and how, when in times of difficulty, we remember that it\u2019s the essentials that we need (food, water, medicine) as opposed to the luxuries that we sometimes unnecessarily give value to. - It is reminding us of how important our family and home life is and how much we have neglected this. It is forcing us back into our houses so we can rebuild them into our home and to strengthen our family unit. - It is reminding us that our true work is not our job, that is what we do, not what we were created to do. Our true work is to look after each other, to protect each other and to be of benefit to one another. - It is reminding us to keep our egos in check. It is reminding us that no matter how great we think we are or how great others think we are, a virus can bring our world to a standstill. - It is reminding us that the power of freewill is in our hands. We can choose to cooperate and help each other, to share, to give, to help and to support each other or we can choose to be selfish, to hoard, to look after only our self. Indeed, it is difficulties that bring out our true colours. - It is reminding us that we can be patient, or we can panic. We can either understand that this type of situation has happened many times before in history and will pass, or we can panic and see it as the end of the world and, consequently, cause ourselves more harm than good. - It is reminding us that this can either be an end or a new beginning. This can be a time of reflection and understanding, where we learn from our mistakes, or it can be the start of a cycle which will continue until we finally learn the lesson we are meant to. - It is reminding us that the true heroes are not the movie stars or sports stars that we put on a pedestal, but the doctors, nurses, care-workers etc. that dedicate their lives to helping people on a daily basis. - It is reminding us that this Earth is sick. It is reminding us that we need to look at the rate of deforestation just as urgently as we look at the speed at which toilet rolls are disappearing off of shelves. We are sick because our home is sick. - It is reminding us that after every difficulty, there is always ease. Life is cyclical, and this is just a phase in this great cycle. We do not need to panic; this too shall pass. Whereas many see the Corona/ Covid-19 virus as a great disaster, I prefer to see it as a great corrector. It is sent to remind us of the important lessons that we seem to have forgotten and it is up to us if we will learn them or not.",

        "content": "From the brilliance of Dr. James Lyons-Weiler:\n\n\"The available evidence most strongly supports that the 2019-NCoV virus is a vaccine strain of coronavirus either accidentally released from a laboratory accident, perhaps a laboratory researcher becoming infected with the virus while conducting animal experiments, or the Chinese were performing clinical studies of a Coronavirus vaccine in humans.\n\n\"Dr. Dale Brown brought to my attention the studies that have reported serious immunopathology in animals \u2013 rats, ferrets, and monkeys \u2013 in which animals vaccinated against coronoviruses tended to have extremely high rates of respiratory failure upon subsequent exposure in the study when challenged with the wild-type coronavirus.\"\n\n\"If the Chinese government has been conducting human trials against SARS. MERS, or other coronviruses using recombined viruses, they may have made their citizens far more susceptible to acute respiratory distress syndrome upon infection with 2019-nCoV coronavirus.\n\n\"The implications are clear: if China sensitized their population via a SARS vaccine, and this escaped from a lab, the rest of world has a serious humanitarian urgency to help China, but may not expect as serious an epidemic as might otherwise be expected.\n\n\"In the worst-case scenario, if the vaccination strain is more highly contagious and lethal, 2019-nCoV could become the worst example of vaccine-derived contagious disease in human history. With an uncharacteristic aysmptomatic prodromal period of 5-7 days, individuals returning from China to other countries must be forthright and cooperative in their now-prescribed 2-week quarantine.\"\n\nHere is the article:\nhttps://jameslyonsweiler.com/2020/01/30/on-the-origins-of-the-2019-ncov-virus-wuhan-china/?fbclid=IwAR0STDEBq9pLBrnGlgmzNoMnPOf-DBBAfHW4-lWDVXSF_qL_cY-PX108Jao\n\n#coronavirus",

        "content": "CORONAVIRUS is not a new virus. It has been around for at least two decades and is transmitted from animals to humans and then from humans to humans. It is said to have originated from eating cats, bats, and camels (depending on the strain). 2019-nCoV is a supposedly new strain of the coronavirus that surfaced in mid-December 2019 from a seafood market in China. Now follow with me: In 2004, the CDC filed a patent on a newly isolated coronavirus known as SARS-CoV. It expired on January 24, 2020 -- pure coincidence given the timing of this media outbreak I'm sure. In 2015, the Pirbright Institute filed a patent for a live attenuated coronavirus to be used in the production of vaccines. The Pirbright Institute is funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and recently received $5.5 million dollars to do what they do. They were \"coincidentally chosen\" to create the vaccine behind this current outbreak. They will be partnering with Inovio Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation) to create said vaccine. This company brought you the zika quackxine in a record-breaking 7 months (run ... just ... run). Inovio Pharmaceuticals will be partnering with Wistar (funded by Bill and Melinda Gates), GeneOne (funded by Bill and Melinda Gates and sponsored by the US FDA) and Twist Biosciences (funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation). If the Wistar Institute sounds familiar, it should. This is the company that produced the WI-38 cell line derived from the \"too many to count\" aborted fetuses in the vaccines injected into your children. In October of 2019, the John Hopkins Bloomberg School of Health (Center for Health Security) held \"Event 201,\" which simulated an outbreak of a theoretical coronavirus that ironically, looks exactly like what's playing out right now. It ultimately becomes a childhood disease for which we need to vaccinate against. Guess who it was funded by? The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. You really can't make this stuff up.

        "content": "CORONAVIRUS MUCH WORSE THAN YOU'RE BEING TOLD - THOUSANDS DEAD\n\nMost people don't know this information yet, here is the shocking untold truth. In a town just 7 km from ground zero of the coronovirus in Wuhan, China - the STATE promoted a banquet for 100,000 people. It was communal, meaning everyone was eating off the same dishes. The banquet was held just two days after 59 cases had been confirmed in the same town. This soon to be worldwide deadly pandemic was not an accident, it was planned well in advance.\n\nThis information comes from a few separate sources on the ground in the quarantined zones of China, the death toll and Infection rate are much higher than the media is putting out. People are literally fainting in the street, doctors are collapsing in hospitals, people are dying in high numbers.\n\nThe US government made this virus, it was patented years ago as shown in my previous post. It\u2019s a double sided agenda, use fear to control the population and kill off a large amount of people fast.\n\nVery soon the mainstream news and \"authority\" figures will frantically push the population to get the antivirus vaccine. I predicted last month a deadly virus would appear in 2020 well before the coronavirus was mentioned in the news, things are happening even faster than expected.\n\nThe death toll is in the thousands, not hundreds. Over 25 million people are quarantined to cities in China but the outbreak has already spread. All over the United States cases are popping up, many more infected in Michigan, Seattle, Illinois and by tomorrow expect more reports of new outbreaks, Denver will be next. How much longer will the mainstream news hold out on reporting the truth, a catastrophic large scale event is underway.\n\nI feel it's worth noting: China is building a new hospital frantically with as much man power and resources as humanly possible, all specifically to house new patients for the soon coming pandemic! They started building immediately after the virus was announced, that should be a red flag to everyone.\n\nHow to prepare? Stay in your home if possible, use a mask outdoors when going out is necessary. Do not go into a FEMA camp unless your life depends on it, they are not here to help. If you believe this message is spreading fear, you are not prepared for what's coming.\n\nStay awake, aware and prepared.",
